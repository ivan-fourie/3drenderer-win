# Software 3D Renderer project

A project written in C & SDL to explore writing a software 3D renderer from scratch. This is the slightly modified version of ![my original project](https://github.com/ivan-fourie/3drenderer) targeting Windows/MSVC. The MSVC toolchain requires some modifications to compile the original source code and I used the opportunity to explore Visual Studio 2022 on Windows.

# Dependencies

The main dependency of this project is the SDL2 library. The following instructions were used to configure SDL in Visual Studio Cummunity 2022 with C++ support only: https://thenumbat.github.io/cpp-course/sdl2/01/vsSetup.html
